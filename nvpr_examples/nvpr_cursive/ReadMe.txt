
nvpr_cursive

An NV_path_rendering example using repeated dash array modifications
to give the appearance of animating the stroking of a path tracing the
cursive phrase "This is crazy".

Plus (+) increases the stroke's extent.

Minus (-) increases the stroke's extent.

Space bar toggles animation.

Rotate and zooming is centered where you first left mouse click.
Hold down Ctrl at left mouse click to JUST SCALE.
Hold down Shift at left mouse click to JUST ROTATE.

Use middle mouse button to slide (translate).

Errata:  Early NV_path_rendering implementations show some pixel
cruft during the cursive animation.  This is fixed in current
drivers.
