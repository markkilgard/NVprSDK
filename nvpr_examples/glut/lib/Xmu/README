GLUT's color map creation code depends on XmuLookupStandardColormap.
Unfortunately many X distributions no longer chip with the Xmu library.

Therefore provide a "mini" version of the Xmu source files needed
so glut_cmap.c can include the files it needs.  When PRIVATE_XMU is
defined (enabled by default in GNUmakefile), this code is included.

mini version of X interface library for miscellaneous utilities not part
of the Xlib standard based on libXmu-1.1.2.

See COPYING for license details.
