nvpr_morph

An NV_path_rendering example using glWeightPathsNV and glInterpolatePathsNV
to animate the morphing of a treble clef path.

Space bar toggles animation.

Rotate and zooming is centered where you first left mouse click.
Hold down Ctrl at left mouse click to JUST SCALE.
Hold down Shift at left mouse click to JUST ROTATE.

Use middle mouse button to slide (translate).

Caveat: A now-fixed driver bug in pre-Release 340 drivers causes a
notch in the cubic morphing.
