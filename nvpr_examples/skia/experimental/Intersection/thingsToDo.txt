add unit test for quadratic horizontal intersection
add unit test for cubic horizontal intersection with left/right
add unit test for ActiveEdge::calcLeft (can currently loop forever)
does ActiveEdge::isCoincidentWith need to support quad, cubic?
figure out why variation in ActiveEdge::tooCloseToCall isn't better
why does 'lastPtr - 2' in addIntersectingTs break testSimplifyTriangle22?
add code to promote quad to cubic, or add quad/cubic intersection
figure out why testSimplifySkinnyTriangle13 fails

for quadratics and cubics, once various T values are added, see if consecutive
Ts have ys that go up instead of down. If so, the edge needs to be broken.

when splitting curves at inflection pts, should I retain the original curve
data and note that the first/last T are no longer 0/1 ?
I need to figure this out before I can proceed

would it make sense to leave the InEdge alone, and add multiple copies of
ActiveEdge, pointing to the same InEdge, where the copy has only the subset
of Ts that need to be walked in reverse order?
