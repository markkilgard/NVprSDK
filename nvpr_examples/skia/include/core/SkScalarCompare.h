/** Skia can spend a lot of time just comparing scalars (e.g. quickReject).
    When scalar==fixed, this is very fast, and when scalar==hardware-float, this
    is also reasonable, but if scalar==software-float, then each compare can be
    a function call and take real time. To account for that, we have the flag
    SK_SCALAR_SLOW_COMPARES.

    If this is defined, we have a special trick where we quickly convert floats
    to a 2's compliment form, and then treat them as signed 32bit integers. In
    this form we lose a few subtlties (e.g. NaNs always comparing false) but
    we gain the speed of integer compares.
