# Makefile that wraps the Gyp and build steps for Unix and Mac (but not Windows)
# Uses "make" to build on Unix, and "xcodebuild" to build on Mac.
#
# Some usage examples (tested on both Linux and Mac):
#
#   # Clean everything
#   make clean
#
#   # Build and run tests (in Debug mode)
#   make tests
#   out/Debug/tests
#
#   # Build and run tests (in Release mode)
#   make tests BUILDTYPE=Release
#   out/Release/tests
#
#   # Build bench and SampleApp (both in Release mode), and then run them
#   make SampleApp bench BUILDTYPE=Release
#   out/Release/bench -repeat 2
#   out/Release/SampleApp
#
#   # Build all targets (in Debug mode)
#   make
#
# If you want more fine-grained control, you can run gyp and then build the
# gyp-generated projects yourself.
#
# See http://code.google.com/p/skia/wiki/DocRoot for complete documentation.

# recursively invoked Makefile within out/ _is_ allowed to run in parallel
# (so you can still get some speedup that way).
