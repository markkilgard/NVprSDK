Baseline images originally generated on a Mac Pro

  Model Name:    Mac Pro
  Model Identifier:	MacPro5,1
  Processor Name:	6-Core Intel Xeon

  Chipset Model:	ATI Radeon HD 5770

Ran these commands to generate:
GYP_DEFINES="skia_scalar=float" make gm
out/Debug/gm -w gm/base-macpro

The machine generating these baseline images had a monitor set up in landscape
mode, such that MacOS enabled LCD subpixel text rendering.  If you generate
your own images on a machine with a different monitor setup (e.g. portrait
mode), you may see different pixel values at the edge of text within some
images.  Run skdiff to look for these diffs.

Note: we do NOT currently have a buildbot that validates the correctness of
these images. They are maintained manually by Mike Reed, and may occasionally
be out of date.
