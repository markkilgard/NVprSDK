Subversion uses this directory to map in "external" repositories upon which
we depend.

To see the mappings, cd into this directory and then run:
svn propget svn:externals .

To modify the mappings, cd into this directory and run:
svn propedit svn:externals .

See http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.5/svn.advanced.externals.html for
more info.


NOTE: This set of dependencies must be manually kept in sync with the gclient
DEPS; the output of "svn propget svn:externals ." should always be equivalent
to the content of the "DEPS" file within trunk.
