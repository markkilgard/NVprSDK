 1. What's this?
=================

  The Liberation Fonts is font collection which aims display compatibility to 
  document files that used Times New Roman, Arial, Courier New as fonts.


 2. Requirements
=================

  * fontforge to be installed.
    (http://fontforge.sourceforge.net)


 3. Install
============

  3.1 Decompress tarball

    You can extract the files by following command:

      $ tar zxvf liberation-fonts-[VERSION].tar.gz

  3.2 Build from the source

    Change into directory liberation-fonts-[VERSION]/ and build from sources by 
    following commands:

      $ cd liberation-fonts-[VERSION]
      $ make

    The built font files will be available in 'build' directory.

  3.3 Install to system

    You can manually install the fonts by copying the TTFs to ~/.fonts for user
    wide usage, or to /usr/share/fonts/truetype/liberation for system-wide
    availability.


 4. Usage
==========

  The fonts should be installed and detected by the system after installation. 
  Simply select preferred liberation font in applications and start using.


 5. License
============

  For redistribution information, please read the GPL license file 'COPYING'.

  For EULA information, please read file 'License.txt'.


 6. Maintainers
================

  (FIXME)
    Before packaging a new release based on a new source tarball, you have to
    update the version number in the Makefile:

    VER = [VERSION]

    Make sure that the defined version corresponds to the font software metadata
which you can check with ftinfo/otfinfo or fontforge itself. It is highly recommended that file 'ChangeLog' is updated to reflect
changes.

Create a tarball with the following command:
$ make dist

The new versionned tarball will be available in the dist/ folder as
'liberation-fonts-[NEW_VERSION].tar.gz'.
  (FIXME)
